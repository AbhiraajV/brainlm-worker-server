 the interpreter, the pattern and the inside workers are not working correctly. They are supposed
  to analyse each event properly, so I'll take examples based on apps on the front and side. We have
  multiple apps or sessions which send data with a track type on the event. so event has content
  track type and Rogers. The events track type determines what type of event it is so currently we
  are holding gym track type there is diet track type and then there is habit track type. We also
  have other things like sleep steps and then user can also create custom events which will just be
  like what happened during their day, what is going on in their life all of those things for
  example, I was studying. I forgot to study and then inhabit. There is also reflection so far is
  not believe there's a habit like I don't want to smoke and then they end up smoking they add
  reflections like why did this happen? What should I what could have been done better and similarly
  there are like many other things like events can have various things that the user wants to track
  and want to say that is going on in their life that might be affecting\
  \
  \  The event can basically have a lot of data. Of example, let's take gym event. For example, if the user has tracked the entire workout, the interpreter should be able to say that was this workout bad what happened during the workout like just make some meaning out of it. When did the user fail? Why did the user fail just like basic things and not answer it in a vague way or say vague things  like this interpretation for a gym event: FACTUAL SUMMARY
On February 8, 2026, Abhiraaj completed a gym session focused on chest and triceps, logging a total of 36 reps across 5 sets with a total volume of 2520 kg. He performed exercises including the barbell bench press (70 kg for 8 reps), incline dumbbell press (70 kg for 7 and 8 reps), and standing cable crunches (70 lbs for 8 reps).
Classification:
* Track Type: GYM

UOM Pointer: Abhiraaj is focused on improving his gym performance to achieve his goal of an ideal physique.
   this is very stupid? No use at all  It should have made some better interpretation like why was the failure recorded? What was the exact progression? What was the exercises done? What was the flow in? Which exercise was done? What did the coach have to say and what? How much did it make sense? It is just simply repeating what is already written in the events and what is already written by the coach. Yes, we do need some data to be output by the interpreter so that we can run the embedding on it and get proper embedding surgery, also that part should be done. It can output some tags at the end for that, but at the same time, the interpretation of the event should make sense. It should interpret what the session was like. How was the gym session? How was the diet session today? How was the habit tracking today not just output. This vaguely what has happened but make sense of it for example in the above on 
  an interpretation would have been over. We can see that maybe because he was tired on the first bench press. He failed the second set, but still still somehow he was able to do incline bench for many wraps. It could indicate that he has a stronger upper than middle chest and lower text things like that an interpretation could be like oh he’s missing out or lower chest. Is there a reason for that has been logged figure that out and not ask these questions again we cannot give these examples directly to the LM like the one that I just gave you the LLM needs to understand its own purpose of what it is trying to do that is a example for the interpreter, but it it can have multiple other purposes like for example, if a diet fails, if the user had to change the diet change, the plans was hungry for a long time. Why was he hungry? What could you have done? Better? What is a good better meal? Just interpreted not actually make suggestions at this point, but interpret what has happened. It is a very basic thing that the interpreter should understand    the pattern recognise, especially the most important part of this entire thing, but it is acting the most stupid right now. It is just reinforcing stupidly unrelated patterns. I don't know based on what the AI should be able to understand. I think we are doing some kind of similarity and some threshold to understand if there is the reinforcement. It is a new pattern which is very very stupid because we are spending so much on the air. This is the most important part the pattern should make sense for the user. then can be in multiple ways. Let me give you an example, but we can give these examples directly to the AI because these are just very specific examples. The AI will be facing very different use cases continuously. It will never know like what is about to happen, we cannot give example for every case, but here is an example for you. Let's say there is a gym event. A gym event could have like the entire workout of the user. A pattern will be like okay. The user is doing these exercises like this is the workout routine that the user does. This is the sequence in which user likes to do his exercises, but when he did the chest press before the inclined press, he was able to perform better, but when he did it after he was able to performance, became worse when he did back day before chess day, it was better 
when he worked out in the morning. It was better when he worked in the evening. It was better when his workout was just an abs. It was better than it was with tricep and chest like figure out some patterns based on the history of the user. Understand those things based on the current event, then it should also compare it with the other events of the same type, so if the track type is diet compare with other track type diets like what happened in yesterday’s, what happened in the diet or a day before a week before how were the diets different? What is the pattern that we can identify from it when does the user slip from the Dad when does the user definitely stick to the Dad? When is the Dad high protein? When is the diet low? When is the diet perfectly speaking to the users baseline when it is deviating from the base and understand what is happening based on the diet itself for now
then another thing could be. Let's say the user has diet and gym. Understanding what happened before the diet a day before a week before the same day, other events, not just a diet event. So for example, the user tracked via habit that he was smoking that then then we also see that he also binge it that day then it could be okay smoking and binge eating might be related for the user that could be a pattern if fit is seen multiple times and it we don't just reinforce the pattern that is a very stupid thing. We have to rest it over and over again and mention in the pattern that this has been observed and number of times of X number of times, basically not just make it reinforced via a number in the database, but actually say it and identify other patterns also like not just a hard set pattern that smoking leads to binge eating. It could be something like we see that the user smoking lead to being eating and smoking happens when this happens. This happens that happens. We can build on top of patterns and understand things, but again we cannot give all of these examples to the users. It could be emotional. It could be physica could be quantity it could be qualitative. It could be through other sessions. We never know which is the perfect thing, so we have to make the pattern understanding AI understand what it is trying to do. It has multiple things that is doing. It is temporary it session base. It is multiple session based it is sessions and based on daily reviews. It is a lot of things that it has to think about which I think is very easy once is understands what it's purposes.  The insights is not bad. It kind of take the pattern and understand the insights based on that event and but the problem is it is not taking into account. It looks like other events that have happened nearby other similar session events, other similar events based on embedding searches. I don't know if you're feeding it correct data based on track type and based on embedding searches and based on similar events and based on temporary events that have happened near this event, so it should have much more data and then its insight should be based on past history. Two that what could have led to this what has happened and it is kind of just making vague comments if it can't make significant comments then it should kind of say that it would be better if you start tracking this also so that I can understand this part of your life, better, et cetera, et cetera, and at the same time, even if that is being said, it should still make some comments as to what the user should do instead of just saying that we need to figure out strategies for not drinking at night, for example or not smoking or not doing these bad habits because we need to figure out what exactly the stop smoking. What habits the users already doing, which if done more can stop it and then over the time we will start seeing that was the inside that we propose to the user being used. Did it help the user? Is it helping the user like so that we can internally keep growing on that and similarly all the models should do that that basically they're making sure that the user sticks to their baseline keeps growing, so we need to always make insights and everything that are not big, but actionable and at the same time it takes into account the user history and makes the user feel like someone is talking to them. it is, it should not be saying in the third-party the user language or talking to the user with the first name always, but it should talk to the user like it's directly talking to him. See you and his name, et cetera et cetera and basically make sure that it feels very personalise all of the inside of everything at the same time. Helpful the idea of motive is that it will kind of take all of the trackers and all of the journalist that the user does and give the user. The complete picture of the life and understand the users life better than the user so we need to think really deep about these proms have to be perfect and these workers have to be perfec.
