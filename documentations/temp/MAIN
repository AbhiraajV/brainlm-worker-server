layer 1 is just understanding the event in all ways but not halucinating and havign UOM context interpretations and also dumb, biasless ones!
layer 2 is not just temporal,   
    lets say user says: binge ate, oh it might be due to stresss, when   
    else was user stressed? oh i see he also smoked? is there a pattern? 
    what happened before each f these events? oh i see user right after  
    meeting xyz did this? what did xyz say? thats layer 2\               
    \                                                                    
    layer 3 is is binge eating effecting something else?  is stress an   
    issue in users life? are there similar insights already? can i       
    dueduce something new??  also these layers arent alway qualitative   
    therapeurtic or emotional it can also be factual for tracking and    
    growing  example bench press? oh this week lifted more? what caused  
    it? is it the fact that he stoped smokking? yes this is a good       
    insight/ pattern what is missing is\                                 
    \                                                                    
    benched 80kg, next week should try to up it bu 1 rep or rwhatever    
    advice quantitatively bnoth things should work THIS IS VERYY         
    IMPORTANT
